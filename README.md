🩺 Disease Predictor

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of various diseases based on patient health data. The project uses a Jupyter Notebook implementation (Disease_Predictor.ipynb) for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Machine Learning model training and testing

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

User-friendly prediction interface (notebook-based)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

Pandas, NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)

Scikit-learn (machine learning models & evaluation)

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Disease_Predictor.git
cd Disease_Predictor

2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook and run:

jupyter notebook Disease_Predictor.ipynb

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains patient health records with features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, BMI, etc.

Target labels represent whether a person has a disease (binary/multi-class depending on dataset).

(Add dataset source link if public, or mention if confidential/private)

📈 Model Performance

Algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.

Best accuracy achieved: XX% (update based on your results)
